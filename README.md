## Components Required
- Arduino board
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- 10kΩ resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Pin Connections
- VCC of DHT11 → 5V of Arduino
- GND of DHT11 → GND of Arduino
- DATA of DHT11 → Digital Pin 2 of Arduino
- 10kΩ resistor between VCC and DATA pins

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- DHT sensor library

## Getting Started
1. Connect the components according to the wiring diagram above
2. Install the DHT sensor library in your Arduino IDE
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board
4. Open the Serial Monitor to view the temperature and humidity readings
